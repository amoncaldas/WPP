It opens the corresponding social provider login      *    pop-up, using the `clientId` defined in the previous step and allows the user to authenticate.\n *    When it is finished, the component will resolves the promise and brings back a temporary `code`.\n *    We send this `code` to the back-end and there, the `wpp oauth` plugin, using this code we will get a token and then we *    use this token to get the user data, including the user email registered on the provider.\n * 4 - Still on the back-end, having the user's email, we locate the user account on wordpress and generate a standard JWT token.\n * 5 - In the response, we give back the provider token (expected in the response by the vue-authenticate) and\n *    an additional property named `user`, where we put the JWT token and other user`s data. These data are passed\n *    back to who called the this authenticate on the resolver function and the normal authentication continues.\n */\nconst oauthViaPopUp = (context, provider) => {\n  return
