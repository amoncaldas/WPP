Useful to change data in special circumstances.\n *    This function will receive an object with the endpoint and filters (when available) attributes. It is not intended to replace the axios\n *    request interceptor!\n * - transformResponse (function): executed after the request is made, passing the original response object received.\n *    Useful if it necessary to modify the data returned before transforming them in a Model instance\n * - raw (boolean): defines if the default transformation of the results into Model instances must be skipped.\n *    If it is true, the active record will not work with the returned items. Useful when you just want to get data, and not destroy/update them\n * - pk (string): overwrites the default primary key attribute, that is 'id'. Use it if your model on the remote server uses a different field as primary key\n*/\nfunction ModelService (endPoint, resourceName, options) {\n  // if options is not passed, initialize it\n  options = options || {}\n\n  this.endPoint = endPoint\n  this.resourceName = resourceName\n  this.options = options\n\n  /**\n   * Provides an accessor to get the name of the resource\n   */\n  this.getName = () => {\n    return resourceName\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Provides an accessor to get the endpoint\n   * @param String append\n   * @param String prepend\n   */\n  this.getEndPoint = (append, prepend) => {\n    let baseEndPoint = this.endPoint\n    if (append) {\n      baseEndPoint = `${baseEndPoint}/${append}`\n    }\n    if (prepend) {\n      baseEndPoint = `${prepend}/${baseEndPoint}`\n    }\n    return baseEndPoint\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Provides an accessor to set the endpoint\n   * @param String endPoint\n   */\n  this.setEndPoint = (endPoint) => {\n    this.endPoint = endPoint\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Queries the model service endpoint, retrieve the resources and (by default) transform them in active record Models\n   * @param {*} filters  filters to be applied to retrieve the resources\n   */\n  this.query = (filters, endpointAppend = '') => {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      let endPoint = this.endPoint + endpointAppend\n      endPoint += this.buildParams(filters)\n      let request = { endPoint: endPoint, filters: filters, running: 'query' }\n\n      // if the transform request is defined, run it\n      if (options.transformRequest) {\n        options.transformRequest(request)\n      }\n      // run the get action using the http client\n      httpApi.get(request.endPoint, request.filters).then(response => {\n        // add the filters applied to the response so it can be used in some business logic\n        response.filtersApplied = filters\n\n        // if the transform response is defined, run it\n        if (options.transformResponse) {\n          options.transformResponse(response)\n        }\n        // if the raw option is defined, skip the transformation to Model and resolve the promise\n        if (options.raw === true) {\n          response.raw = true\n          resolve(response)\n        } else {\n          // transform each resource returned in a active record Model\n          // @see @/core/model to read more\n          let items = modelCollection(response.data, this)\n          resolve(items)\n        }\n      },\n      error => {\n        reject(error)\n      })\n      .catch(error => {\n        reject(error)\n      })\n    })\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Queries the model service endpoint, retrieve the resources and (by default) transform them in active record Models\n   * @param {*} customOptions  options to be applied to the request.

It opens the corresponding social provider login      *    pop-up, using the `clientId` defined in the previous step and allows the user to authenticate.\n *    When it is finished, the component will resolves the promise and brings back a temporary `code`.\n *    We send this `code` to the back-end and there, the `wpp oauth` plugin, using this code we will get a token and then we *    use this token to get the user data, including the user email registered on the provider.\n * 4 - Still on the back-end, having the user's email, we locate the user account on wordpress and generate a standard JWT token.\n * 5 - In the response, we give back the provider token (expected in the response by the vue-authenticate) and\n *    an additional property named `user`, where we put the JWT token and other user`s data. These data are passed\n *    back to who called the this authenticate on the resolver function and the normal authentication continues.\n */\nconst oauthViaPopUp = (context, provider) => {\n  return
