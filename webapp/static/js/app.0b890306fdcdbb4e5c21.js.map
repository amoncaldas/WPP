vue-authenticate @see https://github.com/dgrubelic/vue-authenticate\n * to login the user. The flow works as following:\n *\n * 1 - in @/main.js vue-authenticate is incorporated into the vue instance using Vue.use(...)\n * 2 - when socialAuth.authenticate is called, it will make a request to the back-end\n *    to retrieve the provider `clientId` and set it to the corresponding @/common/social-auth.js provider `clientId` property.\n * 3 - We call $auth.authenticate, that is a VueAuthenticate accessor. It opens the corresponding social provider login      *    pop-up, using the `clientId` defined in the previous step and allows the user to authenticate.\n *    When it is finished, the component will resolves the promise and brings back a temporary `code`.\n *    We send this `code` to the back-end and there, the `wpp oauth` plugin, using this code we will get a token and then we *    use this token to get the user data, including the user email registered on the provider.\n * 4 - Still on the back-end, having the user's email, we locate the user account on wordpress and generate a standard JWT token.\n * 5 - In the response, we give back the provider token (expected in the response by the vue-authenticate) and\n *    an additional property named `user`, where we put the JWT token and other user`s data. These data are passed\n *    back to who called the this authenticate on the resolver function and the normal authentication continues.\n */\nconst oauthViaPopUp = (context, provider) => {\n  return
